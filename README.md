## React Native + Libraries

This app uses the next libraries:

- @Expo for learning and experimenting with React Native on Android
- @react-native-community/slider for importing Slider components
- @react-navigation/bottom-tabs for creating a bottom interactable menu bar
- @react-navigation/native for navigating between tabs
- expo-clipboard for using the cellphone feature of copying in clipboard
- @react-native-async-storage/async-storage for saving information locally in the app

## Getting Started

After you have cloned this repo, run this setup script to set up your machine
with the necessary dependencies to run and test this app:

    npm install

Finally run the server using:

    npx expo start --tunnel

Please, make sure to have the Expo application in your cellphone. Also, your machine and your cellphone should be connected to the same wifi network.

If you want to learn more about `Expo`, see [the guidelines][expo].
